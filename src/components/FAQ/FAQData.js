'What is a hackathon?', 
'A hackathon is an event where developers, builders, designers, and tech enthusiasts work in teams to create a project. Within a given time limit, hackers will make projects that aim to solve real-world issues and problems. Additionally, hackathons often feature workshops, talks, networking opportunities, and mini-events to help hackers learn new skills and meet new people. At the end of the weekend, hackers will present their projects to a panel of judges and compete for prizes.'
